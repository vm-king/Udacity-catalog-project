# Dog Breed Menu Application

This project creates a web application to display and categorize the 50 most popular dog breeds. The home page shows the 7 breed categories recognized by the American Kennel Club, along with a list of the most recently added breeds. Users can click on a category to see a list of breeds in that category, along with the popularity rank of each breed. Clicking on a breed brings up a photo and description of that breed.

Users can also login using Google Oauth2 authentication. Once logged in, users also have the ability to add, edit, and delete breeds.

This project utilizes Python 3. To start the application, run the command:
```python cat_project.py```

The database for this project is called catalog_project.py. The database_setup.py and pop_db.py files are used to set up and populate the database, respectively.
